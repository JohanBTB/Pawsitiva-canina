## About the web

<p>This website has been created with the purpose of establishing an organization dedicated to assisting stray dogs in finding loving homes. The primary focus is on designing and producing collars equipped with QR codes, which serve as a means to support refugees who work tirelessly to care for these dogs and provide them with a safe haven until they are adopted by someone who will offer them a forever home.

<p>This is only an idea, the website does not exist (◞╭╮◟)</p>
